              Team Work Report

Me : 5
Diti Bhatnagar : 4
Nishtha Sinha : 3


We collaborated on the logic used for the lab and shared ideas as how to solve the designed problem.
We also collaborated on the RTL diagram for the controller.

We met 3 times during the week that is Thursday, Saturday and Monday. We used to text each other to decide about the meeting times.


We helped each other in understanding the code better and find the problems occuring like in Diti case flex counter from previous lab was
wrongly copied and it caused synthesis problem during mapping. I figured it out and helped her solve the problem.

I contributed towards the RTL diagrams, schematics and helped in debugging some of the minor problems in the code like error loading designs, port mapping.

Diti contributed towards designing mealy and moore and thus we learned that moore models are better. Also, she 
helped me debug some minor problems in my avg_four code as I wrongly spelled some of the parameters.

Nishtha conntributed toward understanding the shift by 2 for divide by 4 block and in general helped with the initial part of the counter code and using the defparam declaration.

I learned a lot from this collaboration, it expanded my knowledge, some parts which were not clear earlier became clear as we progressed. Also,
I learned the different ways of thinking to solve a particular problem. I improved at debugging the code while helping them and also understand 
how to read the waveforms better.  Moreover, coding became fun while working with teammates.
