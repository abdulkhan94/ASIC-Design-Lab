Postlab Questions


Answer 1: Data ready must be asserted for at least 2 clock cycles that is 20 ns.

Answer 2:    Pseudo Code

idle : if (data_ready = 0) goto idle; wait until data_ready = 1
store : if (data_ready = 0) goto eidle
	reg[5] = data       ;Store data in a register
	err = 0
sort1: reg[1] = reg[2]     ;Reoder registers
sort2: reg[2] = reg[3]
sort3: reg[3] = reg[4]
sort4: reg[4] = reg[5]
add1: reg[0] = reg[1]*reg[2]
add2: reg[6 = reg[3]*reg[0]
add3: reg[7]= reg[4]*reg[6]
	if (V) goto eidle
		goto idle
eidle: err = 1
	if(data_ready = 1) goto store     ;wait until data is ready
	if(data_ready = 0) goto eidle


Answer 3:
	The filtered image is blurred as compared to the original as it average out the adjacent four pixels and hence makes it clarity low.

Answer 4:
	in_file = $fopen(INPUT_FILENAME, "rb");

Answer 5:
	character(c), float(f),hexadecimal(h), binary(b), decimal(d), octal(o), string(s)
